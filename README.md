This repository contains my submissions for the web development course of the University of Helsinki. You can find the course here: https://fullstackopen.com/.


The course covers the following topics:
1. Fundamentals of Web apps
2. Communicating with server
3. Programming a server with NodeJS and Express
4. Testing Express servers, user administration
5. Testing React apps
6. State management with Redux
7. React router, custom hooks, styling with CSS and webpack
8. GraphQL
9. TypeScript
10. React Native
11. CI/CD
12. Containers

The exercise submissions are organized according to topics listed above. Note that some submissions are contained in a separate repository.
For example, part 3 required a Heroku deployment which is easier to manage in a separate repository.
