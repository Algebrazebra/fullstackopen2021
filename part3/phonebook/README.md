# Phonebook App

This part implements a fullstack phonebook app with a Node.js backend and a react.js frontend. The app is deployed to heroku.

Before deploying, you first need to create the app on Heroku:
```bash
heroku login
heroku create
```

This will create an app with a random name.
To deploy, simply run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

For more build & deploy options, check the scripts defined in `package.json`.
